# Urbanoid

Welcome to my first game on C++ with openGL. <br>
It's my porject to get basic understanding how openGL works, and also practice in C++

## Road map: <br>
+ score board
+ leaderboard
+ add some bonus & antibonus for player (change paddle size, change ball speed, add guns for paddle etc.)
+ support mouse controls
+ improve collision system
+ put some easter eggs :)

## Release Notes: <br>
+ SFX system (v.1.1.0)
